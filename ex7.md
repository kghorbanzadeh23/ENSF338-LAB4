1. The time complexity is $O(N^2)$. As it looks it iterates over the list one by one in reverse making the for loop have a complexity of O(N). Then additionally since this a linked list and we are searching for a element each time in the for loop using get_element_at_pos function while in the for loop which then that operation has a complexity of N*N. So the time complexity would be $O(N^2)$. 

2.  It should be better now as instead the complexity being $O(N^2)$ it is now O(N). Because we are now no longer travesing through the list twice now. As we got rid of calling the function get_element_at_pos, we no longer travesing the list twice. Which makes the complexity O(N).
