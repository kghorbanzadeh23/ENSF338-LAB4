1. The time complexity is O(n^2). As it looks it iterates over the list one by one in reverse making the for loop have a complexity of O(n). Then additionally since this a linked list and we are searching for a element each time in the for loop it would increase the complexity to O(n^2).

2.  It should be better now as instead the complexity being O(n^2) it is now O(n). Because we are now not travesing through the list twice now. As we got rid of calling the function get_element_at_pos, we no longer travesing the list twice. Which makes our complexity O(n).
